A block-based Wordpress plugin for displaying a post archive using HTML summary elements.

Can be seen in action at https://qubitsandbytes.co.uk.

Features:
* Displays posts separated by year and month
* Optional post count next to each month
* Optional plugin post title to fit with legacy plugins. Title uses the same class as the built-in sidebar headings

Note that this is still in active development, and therefore the current feature-set is limited.

# How To Use
Download the .zip file from releases, and install it through the WordPress 'Upload Plugin' feature. If you want to clone the repository, you'll need to build the extension before it will run.

The release tagged 'latest' is considered the current version, with a second release (labelled pre-release) reflecting the latest state of the repository. Builds are automated on each commit.

To access the additional settings, select the block and click the 'see more settings' menu item.

# Future Development
The following features are planned for future versions of the plugin:
* Additional theming options
